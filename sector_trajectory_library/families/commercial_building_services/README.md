# commercial_building_services

## What the family represents

This family covers `commercial_building_services` in sector `buildings` / subsector `commercial` for region `AUS`. The canonical output role is `required_service`, with output measured in `GJ_service_eq`. Buildings are represented as **aggregate service bundles** rather than explicit end-use processes.

## Output/service definition

- Family id: `commercial_building_services`
- Output/service name: `commercial_building_services`
- Output unit: `GJ_service_eq`
- Output quantity basis: Baseline-normalised building service bundle. One unit approximates the useful service delivered by one GJ of incumbent 2025 final-energy use in this subsector.
- Default incumbent state id: `buildings__commercial__incumbent_mixed_fuels`

## State inventory

- buildings__commercial__deep_electric — Deep electrification and efficiency commercial services
- buildings__commercial__electrified_efficiency — Electrified efficient commercial services
- buildings__commercial__incumbent_mixed_fuels — Incumbent mixed-fuel commercial services

All state ids are authored across milestone years 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050.

## Why the current state set is sufficient

The Phase 1 package keeps 3 state ids for this family so the explorer and solver can distinguish the incumbent baseline from the main transition options without expanding straight to a process-chain model. The state option metadata carries standardized ordering, default-incumbent selection, and pathway codes so downstream tooling can keep this family internally consistent.

## Known caveats

- Baseline coefficients reproduce official commercial final-energy fuel shares in 2023–24 when service demand equals 314.2 PJ_service_eq.
- Captures a pragmatic commercial electrification pathway without requiring full end-use disaggregation in Phase 1.
- The most aggressive near-zero-direct-emissions commercial service state in Phase 1.

## Expansion path

- Split into space conditioning, water heating, cooking and appliances, with new-build versus retrofit variants.
